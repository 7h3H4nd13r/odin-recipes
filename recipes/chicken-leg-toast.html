        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken drumsticks</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced celery</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced onion</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup creme fraiche or heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 thick slices day old French bread (1 to 1 1/2 inch thick)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter for browning bread, plus a teaspoon for greasing pan</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For optional "Dragon Syrup"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken drumsticks, carrots, onions, celery, and broth in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn drumsticks over, cover, and cook for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken and transfer to a plate. Allow to cool, wrap, and transfer into the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <li>Turn heat to medium-high and reduce cooking liquids in the saucepan to about 1/3 cup. Strain liquid into a mixing bowl, pressing some of the cooked vegetables through the sieve. Season gravy with black pepper, salt, thyme leaves, lemon zest, and cayenne; add creme fraiche and eggs and whisk everything together until a smooth batter forms.</li>
            <li>Place bread in a shallow baking dish just large enough to fit the slices, and pour over the batter. Toss several times, wrap and place in the fridge for 1 hour or until almost all the batter is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease with butter.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat and brown bread for a few minutes per side. Transfer bread onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Press one drumstick into the top of each slice of bread. Brush over any excess batter. Sprinkle with salt, dust with Parmesan cheese, and finish with a shake of cayenne.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together maple syrup, Sriracha hot sauce, and cayenne pepper in a little bowl ("dragon syrup").</li>
            <li>Serve chicken leg toast drizzled with dragon syrup.</li>
        </ol>
